## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this pricing component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- Control the toggle with both their mouse/trackpad and their keyboard
- **Bonus**: Complete the challenge with just HTML and CSS

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sanitize.CSS](https://csstools.github.io/sanitize.css/) - CSS reset for more consistant cross-browser styling

### What I learned

Learned how to make a toggle button.

### Continued development

In the future, I would like to attempt to complete this project using only HTML and CSS as a bonus challenge.
